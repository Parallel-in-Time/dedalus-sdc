# IMEX Spectral Deferred Correction (SDC) solver for Dedalus

:scroll: _This project focus on the implementation of an IMEX-SDC solver for the [Dedalus framework](https://dedalus-project.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) that can be used to solve partial differential equations using spectral methods (Fourier based, not polynomial)._

Spectral Deferred Correction were originally developed by [Dutt and Greengard](#dutt2000spectral) in order to provide generic time integration method with arbitrary high order of accuracy.
They received a particular attention with the development of time-parallel methods, in particular with 
[Parallel Deferred Correction](#guibert2007parallel) or 
[PFASST](#emmett2012toward) allowing time-parallelization across the time-steps, or [Parallel Diagonal SDC](#speck2018parallelizing) allowing parallelization across the stages within a time-step.
This code intend to investigate the **accuracy** and **performance** of those methods when used in combination with the spectral method of Dedalus.

The IMEX-SDC solver can be used to solve initial value problem of the form :

$$
\mathcal{M} \cdot \partial_t \mathcal{X} + \mathcal{L} \cdot \mathcal{X} = \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{X}, t)
$$

where $\mathcal{L}$ is a linear term, solved implicitly with Dedalus internal solvers, and $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{X}, t)$ a (non-)linear term solved explicitly.
See [Dedalus documentation](https://dedalus-project.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/dedalus_tutorial_3.html#Problem-formulations) for more details and how to set up all those terms.
